NAME
    Catalyst::Plugin::Charsets::Japanese - Japanese specific charsets
    handler

SYNOPSIS
        use Catalyst 'Charsets::Japanese';

        # set charset
        MyApp->config->{charsets} = 'UTF-8';

        # you can set two charsets.
        # one is for inner, another is for output response.

        MyApp->config->{charsets} = {
            in  => 'EUC-JP',
            out => 'Shift_JIS',
        };

DESCRIPTION
    Japanese usually use the charsets, UTF-8, EUC-JP, and Shift_JIS, when
    they develop web applications. This module allows you to deal with
    things related to Japanese charset automatically.

charsets
    This plugin implements 'charsets' accessor to context object.

        sub default : Private {
            my( $self, $c ) = @_;

            # charset's name. UTF-8, EUC-JP, Shift_JIS
            my $inner_charset = $c->charsets->in->name;

            # charset's abbreviation. utf8, euc, shiftjis
            my $inner_abbrev  = $c->charsets->in->abbreviation;

            # Jcode method's name. utf8, euc, sjis
            my $inner_method  = $c->charsets->in->method;

            # and you can get information about charset for output response.
            my $outer_charset = $c->charsets->out->name;
        }
